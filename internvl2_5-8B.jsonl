This will help you maintain control and sensitivity to any changes in the ground. 2. **Use the Tip of the Cane**: Extend the cane in front of you, allowing the tip to make contact with the ground. The tip of the cane is designed to be sensitive to changes in the surface, such as bumps, dips, or obstacles. 3. **Listen for Changes**: As you walk, pay close attention to any changes in the sound or sensation of the cane tip hitting the ground. A sudden change in sound or resistance indicates the presence of an obstacle. 4. **Adjust Your Path**: If you detect an obstacle, stop and adjust your path around it. Use your other senses, such as hearing and touch, to navigate around the obstacle safely. 5. **Practice with Yuki**: Since Yuki is your guide dog, practice walking with her to become more familiar with her movements and how she responds to obstacles. This will help you both work together more effectively. 6. **Stay Alert**: Always stay alert and focused while walking. This will help you quickly detect any obstacles and react appropriately. By following these steps, you can effectively use your cane with Yuki to detect obstacles ahead and navigate safely."}

The tip of the cane should be pointing towards the street. 3. **Move Forward**: Slowly move forward, keeping the cane tip in contact with the ground. The cane will help you detect any changes in the surface, such as the transition from the sidewalk to the street. 4. **Detect the Curb**: As you move forward, the cane will hit the curb. You will feel a change in the surface, usually a slight drop or a different texture. This indicates that you have reached the edge of the sidewalk and are now on the street. 5. **Cross the Street**: Continue moving forward until you reach the other side of the street. The cane will help you navigate around obstacles and detect any changes in the terrain. 6. **Locate the Sidewalk on the Other Side**: Once you are on the other side of the street, the cane will help you detect the curb again. You will feel another change in the surface, indicating the edge of the sidewalk.

For example, if someone else is moving items, they might be near a shelf. 3. **Reach Out**: Extend your arm and reach out in the direction you think the shelf is. You can use your other hand to guide your movement. 4. **Feel for the Edge**: As you reach out, feel for the edge of the shelf. Shelves often have a distinct texture or feel compared to other surfaces. 5. **Adjust Your Position**: If you don't feel the shelf immediately, adjust your position slightly and reach out again. Shelves are usually at a consistent height, so you can use this to your advantage. 6. **Place the Item**: Once you locate the shelf, carefully place your item on it.
