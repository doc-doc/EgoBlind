{'question_id': 'v_00954_6', 'pred': 'To detect obstacles ahead using your cane with Yuki, you can follow these steps: 1. **Hold the Cane Firmly**: Ensure that you are holding the cane firmly in your hand. This will help you maintain control and sensitivity to any changes in the ground. 2. **Use the Tip of the Cane**: Extend the cane in front of you, allowing the tip to make contact with the ground. The tip of the cane is designed to be sensitive to changes in the surface, such as bumps, dips, or obstacles. 3. **Listen for Changes**: As you walk, pay close attention to any changes in the sound or sensation of the cane tip hitting the ground. A sudden change in sound or resistance indicates the presence of an obstacle. 4. **Adjust Your Path**: If you detect an obstacle, stop and adjust your path around it. Use your other senses, such as hearing and touch, to navigate around the obstacle safely. 5. **Practice with Yuki**: Since Yuki is your guide dog, practice walking with her to become more familiar with her movements and how she responds to obstacles. This will help you both work together more effectively. 6. **Stay Alert**: Always stay alert and focused while walking. This will help you quickly detect any obstacles and react appropriately. By following these steps, you can effectively use your cane with Yuki to detect obstacles ahead and navigate safely.'}
